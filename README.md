CS345 Software Engineering Project - Mixed Fraction Arithmetic Calculator

This project is a Java-based Mixed Fraction Arithmetic Calculator, created as part of the CS345 Software Engineering course. The calculator is designed to perform arithmetic operations on mixed fractions, making it easy to handle complex calculations. One of the key features of this project is the ability to export a customized JAR file with a custom logo and color scheme tailored for different clients.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and import it into your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
Prerequisites

    Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
    A Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)

Importing the Project

    Open your Java IDE and select File > Import... or File > Open... depending on your IDE.
    Browse to the directory where you cloned the repository, select the project folder, and click Open or Import.
    The IDE should automatically configure the project based on the included configuration files.

Running the Application

    Locate the main class file (e.g., src/app/Fragile.java).
    Right-click on the main class file and select Run As > Java Application or the equivalent option in your IDE.
    The calculator should launch, and you can start performing mixed fraction arithmetic operations.

Customizing the Application

To customize the logo and color scheme for a specific client, follow these steps:

    Open the JAR export wizard located in the project files (e.g., src/app/jarExport).
    Follow the on-screen prompts to select a custom logo image and color scheme.
    The wizard will generate a customized JAR file with the specified settings.
    Distribute the JAR file to your client for deployment.
